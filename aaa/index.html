    <h1 id="HeadingTwo">Who am I?</h1>
    <p id="PTwo">Who am I? Well, I am an enthusiastic coder by the name of Surya Pai who loves learning more of the vast world of 
        coding, and someone who loves exercising their creativity and developing new programs and websites to make the world a 
        wonderful place to live in! Join me in my pursuit of knowledge, as an aspiring software engineer in an everchanging world!</p>
    <h1 id="HeadingTwo">Career Goals</h1>

        protection, working on creating excellet websites, as well as becoming the best there 
        is at coding games and websites. I plan to work everyday to increase my skills in coding with many projects and challenges
    which I can use to challenge myself everyday and learn new aspects of coding. I enjoy looking at coding from different angles
to achieve expertise in things I have never done before. This has always been my choice in life due to my enthusiasm in coding
from a young age, and despite lacking talent, I have always conquered many challenges with hard work and determination.
coding has always been a fun tool in which I can excercise my creativity and imagination with almost no constrains.</p>
    <h1 id="HeadingTwo">Strengths and Experience</h1>
    <p id="PTwo">
        I have always held a knack for finding creative solutions to problems, and filling in blanks when I had a piece of code
        that I didn't understand how to make. Finding creative ways around problems is something that is in my blood, and has
        always been something I pride myself on. Another factor I pride myself on is being flexible and adaptable, as well as learning
        at every moment when I am coding and run into problems.
        <br>
        <br>
        I have many abilities and achievements, although most of those achievements were accomplished challenges of my own, 
        I still pride myself on them due to the fact that I did them on my own, with the help of google. I have learned that
        I am very good at working with a team, accomplishing a lot and having great organizations skills which I could always use
        to increment objectives into smaller goals which I could conquer one by one, resulting in large projects being finished 
        fast and efficiently. I have created the EHS Reading For Relaxation Club to create the perfect stress free environment for book lovers, and have
        done so much more.
